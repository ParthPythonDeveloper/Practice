# Natural Language Processing (NLP) - Basics

## Introduction
Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a branch of Artificial Intelligence (AI) that enables computers to understand, interpret, and generate human language. It is widely used in applications like chatbots, voice assistants, sentiment analysis, and machine translation.

## Key Concepts in NLP

### 1. Text Preprocessing
Before analyzing text, it must be cleaned and structured. Common preprocessing steps include:
- **Tokenization**: Splitting text into words or sentences.
- **Stopwords Removal**: Removing common words (e.g., "is", "the") that add little meaning.
- **Lemmatization & Stemming**: Reducing words to their root form (e.g., "running" â†’ "run").

### 2. Feature Extraction
To process text, we convert words into numerical representations:
- **Bag of Words (BoW)**: Represents text as a collection of words without considering order.
- **TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency)**: Assigns importance to words based on frequency.
- **Word Embeddings**: More advanced techniques like Word2Vec and BERT capture word meanings contextually.

### 3. NLP Models
NLP uses machine learning and deep learning models:
- **Machine Learning Models**: NaÃ¯ve Bayes, Support Vector Machines (SVM)
- **Deep Learning Models**: Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), Transformers (BERT, GPT)

## Applications of NLP
- **Chatbots & Virtual Assistants**: Siri, Alexa, Google Assistant
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Analyzing customer reviews, social media comments
- **Spam Detection**: Filtering out unwanted emails
- **Machine Translation**: Google Translate, DeepL
- **Speech Recognition**: Converting spoken language to text

## Getting Started with NLP
To start working with NLP, you can explore:
- **Libraries**: NLTK, spaCy, Hugging Face Transformers
- **Tools**: OpenAI's GPT API, Hugging Face models
- **Learning Resources**: Fast.ai, Coursera, YouTube tutorials

### Next Steps:
- Install `nltk` and `spaCy` and try basic text preprocessing.
- Experiment with Hugging Face models for text generation.
- Build a simple sentiment analysis project.
